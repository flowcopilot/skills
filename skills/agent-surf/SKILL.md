description: Load this skill before you drive a browser, an iOS or Android device, a simulator or emulator, or a desktop app, or write a shell script that drives one, or when package.json or the task names agent-browser, agent-device, or agent-desktop. Covers web automation, screenshots and scraping, Electron apps and Slack, mobile and TV apps, exploratory QA, and native desktop apps on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Do not load it for Playwright, Cypress, Detox, or XCUITest test files.

# Agent Surf

Three CLIs let an agent act on a live interface. Each one reads the interface as an accessibility tree with short element refs, then clicks, types, and scrolls by ref. Choose the CLI by the surface that the task acts on. Read only the matching reference and its supporting files.

All paths in this file are relative to the folder that contains this SKILL.md. For example, `references/agent-browser/core/index.md` is `<skills folder>/agent-surf/references/agent-browser/core/index.md`.

## Choose a CLI

- Web pages, web apps, and cloud browsers: agent-browser. Start with [core](references/agent-browser/core/index.md).
- iPhone, iPad, and Android devices, iOS Simulator, Android Emulator, and TV apps: agent-device. Start with [agent-device](references/agent-device/agent-device/index.md).
- Native desktop apps and system surfaces such as menus, the menu bar, the tray, and notifications on macOS, Windows, or Linux: agent-desktop. Start with [agent-desktop](references/agent-desktop/agent-desktop/index.md), then read the guide for the operating system.
- Electron apps such as VS Code, Slack, Discord, or Notion: use the agent-browser [electron](references/agent-browser/electron/index.md) workflow, which connects over the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Use agent-desktop when the task also touches native windows or system surfaces.
- Exploratory QA or a bug hunt: use the agent-browser [dogfood](references/agent-browser/dogfood/index.md) workflow for a web app, and the agent-device [dogfood](references/agent-device/dogfood/index.md) workflow for a mobile app.

## Installed versions

Read the bundled reference before the first command. It works when the CLI is not installed. The references are a snapshot of each upstream revision, and the installed CLI can be newer. When a command or flag from a reference fails, run the matching `skills get` command. It prints the guide for the installed version. An upstream guide that says to run `skills get` means the bundled file below:

- `agent-browser skills get <name>`: `references/agent-browser/<name>/index.md`. For example, `agent-browser skills get core` is [core](references/agent-browser/core/index.md).
- `agent-desktop skills get desktop`: [agent-desktop](references/agent-desktop/agent-desktop/index.md). Its named references are [commands-interaction](references/agent-desktop/agent-desktop/references/commands-interaction.md), [commands-observation](references/agent-desktop/agent-desktop/references/commands-observation.md), [commands-system](references/agent-desktop/agent-desktop/references/commands-system.md), [workflows](references/agent-desktop/agent-desktop/references/workflows.md).
- `agent-desktop skills get platform`: the guide for the current operating system, `references/agent-desktop/agent-desktop-<os>/index.md`, where `<os>` is `macos`, `windows`, or `linux`.
- `agent-desktop skills get <skill> <path>`: `references/agent-desktop/<skill>/<path>`.

For agent-device, run `agent-device help <topic>` when a command shape is unclear.

The slack workflow does not link its supporting files. Use [slack-tasks](references/agent-browser/slack/references/slack-tasks.md) for task recipes and the [report template](references/agent-browser/slack/templates/slack-report-template.md) for a written summary.

Use [jev-desktop](references/agent-desktop/jev-desktop/index.md) only when the user has a clone of the agent-desktop repository and a `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`.

An upstream skill name, such as `core` or `ios-simulator`, means its index.md reference in the same source directory. Both agent-browser and agent-device have a `dogfood` skill. Use the one for the surface under test. Relative paths stay relative to the imported file.

This bundle imports `skill-data/` from agent-browser and `skills/` from agent-device and agent-desktop. The agent-browser discovery stub, plugin metadata, and agent UI metadata are not included.
