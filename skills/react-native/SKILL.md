# React Native

Use the target project's installed versions and the user's task to select references. Read only the relevant workflow and its supporting files.

## Choose a source

- For animations, gestures, audio, on-device AI, rich text, JSI, and worklets, start with [Software Mansion's best practices](references/software-mansion/react-native-best-practices/index.md).
- For profiling, rendering, startup time, memory, and bundle size, start with [Callstack's best practices](references/callstack/react-native-best-practices/index.md).
- For navigation, upgrades, TV, library creation, CI, or migration, select the matching Callstack workflow below.
- For Software Mansion libraries and tools, select the matching Software Mansion workflow below. These workflows can also cover web or native platforms; apply only the parts relevant to the task.

Both upstream skills named react-native-best-practices are preserved. Their source directories prevent filename collisions. A request to read an upstream skill means its index.md reference in the same source directory. Relative paths remain relative to the imported file. When advice overlaps, use the guidance that matches the installed library and version; resolve conflicting claims against current official documentation.

This bundle imports the skills directories of both repositories, including nested skills. Plugin configuration and externally hosted skills linked by upstream READMEs are not included.
