# RNRepo

Software Mansion's infrastructure for pre-building and distributing React Native library artifacts, reducing native build times by up to **2×** with zero infrastructure changes.

Read the relevant reference for the topic at hand. All references are in `references/`.

## Key facts

- **Beta, New Architecture only.** Works with React Native latest patches of 0.77, 0.78, 0.79 and all versions above 0.80.0.
- **How it works:** A Gradle plugin (Android) and CocoaPods plugin (iOS) intercept the build and substitute libraries with prebuilt artifacts from `packages.rnrepo.org`. Falls back to source if a prebuild is unavailable.
- **Expo CNG:** Use `@rnrepo/expo-config-plugin` — it configures both Android and iOS automatically.
- **Standard RN:** Install `@rnrepo/build-tools` and edit `android/build.gradle`, `android/app/build.gradle`, and `ios/Podfile` manually.
- **Opt out per library:** Add a `rnrepo.config.json` with a `denyList` at the project root. Required for libraries with **native patches** (Objective-C/Java/Kotlin). JS-only patches do NOT require opting out.
- **Opt out entirely:** Set `DISABLE_RNREPO=1` environment variable before the build command.
