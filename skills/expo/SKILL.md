# Expo

Read [expo-overview](references/expo-overview.md) for shared setup rules, then load the references that match the user's goal. Expo documentation and the installed Expo and EAS CLIs are the source of truth.

Former Expo and EAS skill names refer to the workflow files below. Load those references when an imported instruction asks for another skill or its SKILL.md. Paths in workflow references are relative to that reference; `<skill-root>` means this combined expo directory. The upstream overview mentions expo-tailwind-setup, which is not present in this source collection; consult current Expo documentation for that topic.

This package contains skill instructions and helper scripts. Plugin MCP configuration and telemetry hooks are not installed by this package.

## Start Here

Load this first for any Expo/EAS task, then route to the specific skill below.

| Skill | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| [expo-overview](references/expo-overview.md) | Router and shared setup rules; the entry point when a request is vague or the user hasn't named a specific Expo tool. |

## Framework (open source)

Free, open-source Expo SDK and React Native skills. Descriptions are prefixed `Framework (OSS).`, except `expo-skill-feedback`, which accepts feedback across Expo surfaces.

| Skill | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| [expo-project-structure](references/expo-project-structure.md) | Folder structure for a new Expo app: `src/` layout, routes-only `app/`, screens, server code, platform-specific files. |

| [expo-ui](references/expo-ui.md) | `@expo/ui` native components: universal cross-platform first, plus SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose. |
| [expo-data-fetching](references/expo-data-fetching.md) | API calls, React Query, SWR, caching, offline support, and Expo Router data loaders. |
| [expo-dom](references/expo-dom.md) | Expo DOM components for gradually using web code in native apps. |
| [expo-web-to-native](references/expo-web-to-native.md) | Migrating an existing web/React app (Next.js, Vite, CRA) to a native iOS/Android app with Expo. |
| [expo-module](references/expo-module.md) | Expo native modules and views with Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript, config plugins, and autolinking. |
| [expo-brownfield](references/expo-brownfield.md) | Adding Expo or React Native to an existing iOS or Android app. |
| [expo-dev-client](references/expo-dev-client.md) | Development clients (local builds are free; EAS Build/TestFlight is a paid step). |
| [expo-examples](references/expo-examples.md) | The `expo/examples` repo of `with-*` integrations to adapt or scaffold from. |
| [expo-app-clip](references/expo-app-clip.md) | iOS App Clip targets, AASA files, associated domains, and Smart App Banners. |
